I'm always working on a few personal projects, but here are a few of my favorites:

### Colors
Answer a few questions about which colors you think look good together, and train your own little random-forest decision tree classifier to give you suggestions on new color pairings you'll probably like! [Source on Github](https://github.com/pickledish/Colors)

### Spellcheck
A different kind of spelling corrector -- instead of choosing how to correct a word based on edit distance, how common the word is, or randomness, we instead try to find the English word with the smallest _keyboard_ distance to what you typed, as per a standard U.S. layout keyboard. Written in Haskell. [Source on Github](https://github.com/pickledish/spellcheck)

### Healing Game
An experiment in concurrent message-passing protocols I made while I was teaching myself Elixir! It's little CLI game modeled after World of Warcraft-style boss fights I would play in high school. It may not be fun or balanced, but at least it doesn't cost $15 a month! [Source on Github](https://github.com/pickledish/heal)

### Trashpad
Attempts to do for notes what ShoutKey does for links -- makes it easy to create a collaborative note sheet and share it with people near you via word-of-mouth. Uses a peer-to-peer OT (operational transformation) library, in conjunction with a CodeMirror-based text editor called Firepad (with help from Firebase, both Google).
