### [brandon [at] willett.io](mailto://brandon@willett.io)

Email will always be the best way to contact me -- I view it as a big to-do list, and it stares me right in the face every morning, which makes it hard for me to forget about.

### [GitHub](https://github.com/pickledish)

The source for this very website (along with most of my other projects) is always up-to-date here. I would quit CS entirely if it weren't for Git.

### [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/brandonwillett)

For the more professional(?) side of things. I don't check this site very often, though, so reaching me via email is usually a better bet.
