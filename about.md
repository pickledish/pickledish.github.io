**A few paragraphs more**:

I'm a software person. I've been messing with computers since middle school (I remember coming _this close_ to getting a copy of [Mandriva Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva_Linux) I'd burned onto a CD-RW installed in a school computer lab, much to my teacher's chagrin). I started programming in high school and never looked back; the decade-plus of learning the subject has given me is a gift.

Studying computer science and math in college was a fun experience. It was almost entirely theory (since, if you were studying CS for the sake of, you know, writing programs, you would be going to [RIT](https://www.rit.edu) two miles down the road). But I still took a lot away from it.

After graduating, I spent about two years at a marketing tech company (helping build a data warehouse off of [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org)), and then about three years at an infrastructure observability company (helping ensure the dozens of metrics services didn't collapse under ever-multiplying intake). I've also really enjoyed my time in these places; they taught me a lot about some right and wrong choices that can be made designing a distributed system.

Today, I like to build straightforward, reliable software with straightforward, reliable people.
