Who am I?

Well, take a look around: not really a web developer! Right now I'm working as a site reliability engineer (lots of fun!) at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com) in Manhattan, previously worked on distributed query execution at [ActionIQ](https://www.actioniq.com).


In the two years I spent at ActionIQ, I realized what a difference observability and reliability practices


In May of 2018, I graduated from the University of Rochester (in tropical Rochester NY), with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Math. This was a great place for me -- it allowed me to push the limits of what I thought I could achieve, while spending a lot of time teaching others about the _true meaning_ of nondeterminism, trying a hundred new and difficult things, and ultimately figuring out a bit more about what was really important to me.

With respect to the academic, computer-science-y world, leaving school hasn't diminished my love of learning at all. In fact, while I spent most of my time studying algorithms and complexity theory in college, I'm enjoying the freedom I have now to read about whatever I'm most interested in! At the moment, this consists mostly of advances in compiled languages, effect systems, and "finding the balance" when it comes to abstraction: in line with my majors, I love the idea that advances in abstract math (type theory in particular) can make our real lives as developers easier and safer. If you want a peek into some specific things I like to read about, check out these links:

- ["What is the next big step in compiled languages?"](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/253769.html)
- [The Law of Leaky Abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/)
- [Rust's language ergonomics initiative](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/03/02/lang-ergonomics.html)




And, outside of the black hole that is tech, I like to make lists, lists of lists, and very mediocre cups of coffee (given how much effort I put into it). In terms of actual hobbies, my favorite way to unwind is to get on my road bike (a beautiful steel [All City Mr. Pink](/assets/bike.jpg)) and push out a few miles on a Sunday morning before things get too busy. Definitely a bit harder to pull off since moving to NYC (Rochester was amazing for this), but I'm doing my best! I've also recently been getting more into all things small, sustainable, independent, and local. To get a taste of what I mean by that, here are a few things I love reading about or being involved with:
