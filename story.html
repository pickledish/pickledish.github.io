				<h1> OUR STORY </h1>

				<hr width='25%'>

				<p> LOUVRE was founded in the spring months of 2009 when two California girls and one New Yorker joined forces in hopes of creating a new, intensive, athletically focused contemporary dance group for the University of Rochester community. The guiding force: a passion for movement expression and a strong desire for continued technical training, rehearsal, and performance. Upon recruiting a few dedicated contemporary dancers, the ensemble took its initial form. Six girls began taking countless trips to the MAC in the late weekday and early weekend hours, proof enough that Louvre was taking flight. Extremely delighted with the dedication and excitement of the Rochester dance community, the founding members took to the paperwork. In September of 2009, Louvre was officially recognized as a new performing arts student organization on the University of Rochester River Campus. </p>

				<p> Since then, Louvre has been training and performing in full force. In November of 2009, we presented our debut performance on the U of R campus entitled Overture. In spring of 2010, we traveled to our first regional competition in Syracuse where we entered two pieces, Heartbreaker and Use Somebody, which both received divisional first place overall awards. We also received a special judges award for our performance. Louvre finished off its first year with a spring showcase entitled Translate, our strongest and most attended performance of the year. </p>

				<p> Now, Louvre presents two shows annually in addition to attending competition in the spring. We are extremely proud of what we have accomplished this far and aim to continue to provide professional contemporary dance to the University of Rochester and the Rochester community.</p> <br>
