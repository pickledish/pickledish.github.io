Take a look at this [recent Q&A post about burnout](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33260525) on Hacker News (an online forum for nerds), where the author is having some problems being happy in their working environment and is looking for advice. In particular, check out the most popular responses to the post, which (to me) all look in one way or another similar to this one:

> This advice is going to be hated by a lot of people but... care less. You’re in an industry that values your skills and seems to always have demand. Whether or not that’s true in the future, it certainly is today, so the best thing you can do is put yourself first and worry less about work as a whole...

And, I do hate it! But not because it's bad advice -- let's dig in a little bit.

First of all, the fact that this is the highest-voted comment on the page indicates that the sentiment really isn't so unpopular. It's a rational, sensible statement, right? The author used to [[try very hard at work]], was taken advantage of for years, and now doesn't feel like all that work has "paid off" in terms of satisfaction or validation -- what reason _would_ there be to stay invested in work like that?

Just "checking out" is a clean and simple solution to the issue, and it's especially alluring given how easy it seems. There's no need for any [[hard conversations, quitting, or expensive choices]], just a shift in perspective. I believe it's for this reason that you'll find this genre of advice all over the place -- to keep on the Hacker News theme, here's [another recent post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33054652) asking not _how_ to deal with a work situation like this, but instead presupposing that the solution is just caring less, and instead asking how to do _that_.

And advice like this (from where I'm standing anyway) is increasingly popular even outside of the weird microcosm that is Hacker News. Modern takes on corporate workplace culture have [[correctly]] identified the, let's call it "spiritual difficulty" of being emotionally invested in projects without the corresponding autonomy or [[decision-making power]]. For a few examples of these "modern takes" that I enjoyed, check out:

* [Bullshit Jobs: A Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs)

The problem is that, in my view, this is a pretty toxic solution to an equally toxic problem.

The ability to "care", to get invested in what we're working on and want to do a good job just for the sake of it, is part of what _makes us human_.

Your response to working in an environment that’s made it toxic to care isn’t to try really hard to detach yourself from the human [[need]] to do a good job, it’s to _find a better fucking place to work_!

I don't like this implicit urging from all sides to shove our emotions down someplace and instead come off cool and detached

The world does not need more checked-out losers!
