title: "Is Abstraction Worth the Effort"

I read a lot about abstraction. Both for work and for my own interests, I find it really interesting to see how people are taking challenging, complicated issues and attempting to make them understandable for the average Joe. Back in college, one of my professors would always say that "Computer Science is the science of abstraction", and while I thought it was cute at the time, it's only becoming more clear how correct the statement is: more often, it's seeming to me like the whole developer world is just in a constant struggle to abstract without losing something important to the abyss.

As developers, our entire world is built firmly upon a foundation of abstractions. We rely on them every day, on one level or another, to write code, communicate over the web, and find answers to our problems. And why not? The concept is amazing

Truth be told, it's not at all difficult to find examples of "bad abstractions". The shining (or, very dull, I guess) example in this category would have to be the ORM, or Object-Relational Mapping, that has been criticized() many() times() on the Internet. 

But what _makes_ it bad?

- The main point against abstractions you'll hear is that they're always "leaky". What "leaky" means, in this instance, is that 
- Bad performance
- This

Some people believe that no abstraction can ever be "good enough", these people are Go, Rustaceans or C evalgnesists
But look at compilers! We were able to abstract away _registers_ and _cycles_! 

You just gotta find the balance
