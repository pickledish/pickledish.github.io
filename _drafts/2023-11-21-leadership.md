Definitions first!

Driven by vision vs driven by fear

* In my view, a **good engineering leader** is someone who is, above all else, a believer. They have a clear vision of what the software product needs to become, the humility to change that vision when the situation demands it (along with the bravery to defend that vision in the face of petty or transient headwinds), and they place full trust in their developers to execute on that vision.
* And, a **bad engineering leader** is the opposite. They don’t have a strong and clear vision (so they fall back to “data driven decision-making” and let charts about ___ or cloud spend dictate their prioritization), and lack the necessary humility or bravery (so they stubbornly stick to plans that are doomed to fail, or conversely do rapid fear-driven reprioritization when e.g. a large customer threatens to leave). Above all, they don’t trust their team, and thus try their best to micromanage everyone beneath them.

These are personal definitions, for sure, but I hope they’re also broadly agreeable enough for the purposes of this argument I’m trying to make.

Now, at this point in my career I’ve left several software gigs because of “bad engineering leadership” — or at least, that’s how I viewed it at the time. If only so-and-so director or VP hadn’t been hired, the engineering culture would still be great, and so I’d never have felt like I had no option but to quit!

...right?

Well. Over the last few months, I’ve had some time away from all that (highly highly recommend this by the way), and like how sometimes the answer to a tricky problem only comes to you in the shower when you’re finally not thinking about it, I’ve been able to see that what’s actually been going on isn’t so simple.

I’d been viewing bad engineering leadership as a primary cause of a sick culture, but, I had it backwards. Bad leaders don’t cause toxic organizations — _they’re a symptom of them_.

What I mean by this is -- and I understand this is the core assumption here -- I don't think it's impossible to identify these "bad leaders" until after they're already hired and doing damage. I believe it's very reasonable to see those signs during interviews! And furthermore, to a "good" engineering leader, one of these "bad" ones will almost trigger a gag reflex -- this management style should lead to an immediate "thanks for your time". This isn't something that requires [an FBI investigation to figure out].

So, if it's so "easy" to determine the lemons, why are they hired anyway?

The short version is that, at some point in a company's growth, executives make the choice to allow a person like this in. I know of a few reasons this weird-sounding decision might happen -- maybe the company is experiencing rapid growth and they believe they need the experience of a FAANG-type to keep "scaling", or

I'm sure there are a bunch of others. I don't know. Machinations of Silicon Valley rocket ships.

My point is, at some juncture, the company's true priorities are revealed, and it turns out there are a couple things more important than a positive, transparent, high-trust culture after all.

By the time that's happened, it was already over, you just didn't know it yet.

The one "bad" leader starts ____, ____, and most tragically, bringing in more folks (managers and directors) like themselves. Building an "empire" of toxicity from which the only solution is to leave. I don't think there's a way to fix companies that have made these choices. I have tried.

And, after taking that [solution] a couple of times now, to be honest, I really would like to not have to keep doing it!

To that end, I'm not sure

since it's not a person-problem but a company-problem, the only solution I see is to join a company this won't happen to
