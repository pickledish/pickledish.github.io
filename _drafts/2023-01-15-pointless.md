Recently I've been feeling like I need to be a little more deliberate about wasting time.

Well, first off, that sounds like an oxymoron -- to waste something pretty much exactly means to _not_ be deliberate about using it, right?

And besides (even pretending for a minute that the comment makes sense), it's not exactly a novel concept; in my experience it's easy to find articles and books where the author recommends (or details a personal journey about) taking things slower, quitting the hustle, and learning to smell the roses a bit more.

(Okay, I do _also_ need to do that, but that's not the point.)

The point is, even taking a "productive" and goal-oriented mindset about this, I'm realizing there are things that I want more of in my life that (counterintuitively) _require the [dismissal] of productivity_.

The goals I'm talking about are harder to pin down than the concrete examples I'm used to, like "achieve a GPA of at least 3.8" or "learn enough Ruby to make a simple Rails website" or "[deliver project at work]". I think on some level, I've been attracted to these kinds of goals because they're easier for me to understand.

To tick those boxes will yield some benefits (like [an impressive resume] or a respectable job at a large company), but there are other ___[1] that I won't ever be able to ___ by fixating on such ____ tasks -- ___[1] like "healthy friendships" or "a sense of belonging".

If I want more of _that_ stuff, I'm gonna need to start wasting more time.

I came to this conclusion by watching and learning from some other people in my life who are doing much better than me in these floaty areas ___ --- "how did they do it"?

My partner Hannah, for example, has been working on making friends with the people she works with by sometimes baking desserts and bringing the results to her office (or sending them to remote folks in the mail).

Now, the, uh, _less useful at this moment_ half of my brain recoils at the idea here -- she just goes to the grocery store, burns $50 on ingredients for a cake she'll eat none of, then spends _most of an entire day_ actually constructing the damn thing?

That's a weekend day! You only get two of those! What is she thinking!
