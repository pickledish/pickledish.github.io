Do you ever wonder at the efficiency of a modern life?

So many things that would take hours of effort in a previous life, like washing the laundry by hand, now take minutes of it instead. Entire classes of chores that our parents or grandparents did have been virtually eliminated from the to-do list of the average adult. When was the last time you needed to replace the wick of an oil lamp? Probably never. What a gift incandescent lightbulbs brought to our lives.

## Some Perspective

Much of this sharp upward curve in lifestyle efficiency happened within the last 100 years or so, thanks to advances like the telephone, the automobile, and believe it or not, barges (a huge factor in [the ease of international shipping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN3VFgG922A)). The first-world human condition transformed by modern technology!

In a blink of a generational eye, the everyday elements of \_\_\_ (living life) started to take a lot less time. A trip \_\_\_. The same goes for \_\_\_. You now do all of your banking, investing, and taxes online. You don't even need to leave your _house_ anymore for most things; you just spend a couple of minutes picking out what you need on Amazon, wait two days, and then it appears like magic on your doorstep.

The total and complete abstraction of the "where did this stuff come from?" question is, historically speaking, a _pretty new thing_ for humanity. This ultimate efficiency we've managed to achieve, this frictionless and totally opaque exchange of goods and services, has been known in only the most recent fraction of a percent of recorded human history. \_\_\_ (some reference to spending, for below?).

It's worthwhile to spend 5 minutes exploring how some of this magic happens.

## The Source

Well, exploitation, generally.

The magic we're experiencing is the magic of **outsourcing**, of geographical [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage), where you can save a lot of money on a problem just by moving it somewhere else. And by this point it isn't really even news to most of us. We're at least a bit familiar with the fact that our clothes are sewn under non-ideal conditions in Bangladesh (even though we can't quite place that country on a map), and we've heard in the news references to the negative-but-hard-to-conceptualize impact of our growing [islands of garbage](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/great-pacific-garbage-patch) in the ocean.

And, what a happy coincidence, really! As long as Joe is never directly faced with the full end-to-end impact of his buying a [diamond ring for his wife](https://www.miadonna.com/blogs/news/blood-diamonds-in-2020-what-most-jewelers-dont-want-you-to-know), well, then everyone comes out better off -- De Beers makes a few extra percent on the stone by "virtue" of skirting first-world labor laws, and Joe (kept in the dark about all this, of course) gets to marvel at the convenience of being able to pick up such a beautiful object just a few blocks away from his house, not knowing a single minute of its history.

The fact that it's so easy to not look behind the curtain, to remain blissfully unaware of what you're really paying for, is _no mere accident_. Large corporations, the kind that are big enough to start wondering how they can be shaping the opinion of the American public themselves, have been putting effort into exactly \_\_\_ [for decades](https://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/the-passionate-eye/recycling-was-a-lie-a-big-lie-to-sell-more-plastic-industry-experts-say-1.5735618).

We're now living in a society that not only forces unethical goods and services upon us as often the only (practical) option, but one that also has incentivized lots of well-funded entities to work as hard as they can making sure we don't even know about it.

What I'm getting at is, if you don't know where it came from, how it got to you, and where it's going after, then at this point you cannot trust it.

## A Few Examples

To help make the point a little more real, let's look at a few examples that most folks come acros often in everyday life. Some of these you might have encountered before, others might be new to you.

- **Clothing**. Most people are aware now that all the larger retailers outsourced the sewing of their clothes decades ago to abused adults (and children) in developing countries. What might not be as known is how rapidly this shift away from buying local happened. In 2020, the amount of American-made clothing made up just 2 percent of what was purchased by American consumers, down from [_95 percent_ in 1960](https://www.kqed.org/lowdown/7939/madeinamerica). <br/>
<br/>

- **Trash**. The fact that we can produce any amount of household waste, of any variety, and have it whisked away from the curb every week certainly falls into the "feels like magic" category. Of course, the reality is that most of this trash is just wrapped in plastic and thrown in a landfill, never to biodegrade. And while you may think you're helping by cleaning and recycling your cans and bottles, there too they're taking advantage of you not seeing [where it all goes](https://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/the-passionate-eye/recycling-was-a-lie-a-big-lie-to-sell-more-plastic-industry-experts-say-1.5735618). <br/>
<br/>

- **Meat**. This one's been getting a lot of press recently, and for good reason. You could already be concerned about the proven destructive effects of non-local factory farming on the animals, the environment, and your own health, but as is the way of \_\_\_(big business), it's also [destroying family businesses](https://abevoelker.com/2019-03-06/on-the-death-of-my-familys-dairy-farm). <br/>
<br/>

- **Investing**. Congratulations, you're making enough money to start socking some away for your retirement! Will you follow the [modern personal finance advice](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) and put it into a whole-market index fund, where you won't need to worry about it much? It's one of the most sensible options... and if you do, be aware that you're largely supporting (and hinging your life's savings on, even) the slave labor of Apple, the dystopian spying of Facebook, and the worker exploitation of Amazon, [to name a few](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/overview/VTSAX/portfolio-holdings). <br/>
<br/>

- **Politics**. In _abstract_, this concept of "electing representatives" sounds like such a good idea! Average people don't have enough time or context to be up-to-date on every issue, so we can just outsource it, hire smart folks that we agree with to handle it for us. In _reality_, [countless]() [books]() [have]() [been]() [written]() about the XYZ

[COP OUT] I don't think any one link would suffice for the ceaseless cruelty and exploitation these people have wrought using the power of their offices.

## What I'm Trying

As you can see, the above categories make up some of the most fundamental pillars of life in our society. In effect, there's no escaping it

If you're thinking to yourself "hey, this all sounds very Season 3 of The Good Place" you'd be right!

- buy vegetables
- buy local
- buy used
- don't buy at all

To be honest, it still feels like fighting a losing battle most of the time, but I try to celebrate the victories where I can. It's better than not fighting at all.

## TRASH BELOW THIS LINE

(keep?) But most times \_\_\_(we're not much more the wiser), perhaps because we're scared of what we'll find.

(keep?) And if that's still too much effort, you can even have someone _else_ pick out what you might like, and then the contents of your package are a surprise.

And in a blink of a generational eye, any role the consumer had in the \_\_\_ of common goods vanished. Why go all the way to fish market to pick out a fish for dinner when you can just stop by Walmart and grab a filet on the way home? The same goes for books, clothing, gifts -- in each case, we've replaced a stop to an individual shop (and some small interaction with an individual shopkeeper) with something faster, cheaper, and easier. An all around-win for the average Joe, no doubt.

\_\_\_[era-wise] overnight, the consumer was completely removed from the process of producing a filet or sewing a button-down shirt. Why go out of your way to visit the fish market or seamstress now (with all the talking-with-the-shopkeeper, discussing-the-available-options, and other involvement that entails), when you can just pick up all of the above (and so much more) at the Walmart on your way home from work? It's faster, cheaper, and an easier shopping experience, after all, so it seems like an obvious choice.

These goods have been perfectly, deliberately, and \_\_\_ separated.

If it feels like "magic", that you can benefit
