title: "Goofiness as an Indicator of Psychological Safety"

Whew, that title's a mouthful.

So, let's kick off with definitions, courtesy of Google and Wikipedia respectively:

* __Goofiness__ is behavior that's "foolish or harmless eccentric". It's when people post memes in an incident channel while waiting for a bugfix release to finish building, or when you respond to someone's question with a little joke and _then_ the real answer, instead of just delivering that answer outright.
* __Psychological safety__ is "the belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes". It's when you trust your coworker to have faith in your intelligence and workshop a half-baked idea with you, instead of just writing you off as a dummy and moving on.

Maybe they don't seem to have really anything to do with each other. Well, I'm arguing that they might, or, at least they do for me.

I've always been pretty goofy at work. Why not, right? Work is what we're all doing for most of our hours on most of our days, we might as well try to make it a little entertaining. Every smile I can help generate is a middle finger to that big looming ball of ennui that's always threatening to consume us white-collars whole.

...but. I've realized there are some times I stop being goofy. It's not a conscious thing -- just, in some situations it doesn't feel like such a great idea. I fall back to straightforward and uninteresting communication instead.

There are some circumstances where this is totally normal and indeed the right thing to do! For example, when a teammate has just gotten some bad news -- not a good time to start with the puns. Tact and all that.

But other times, I find myself toning down my natural goof because, I guess one way to phrase it is "I'm not positive it will be taken the right way". Maybe the person I'm talking to doesn't know me very well, or maybe they're just of a very different background to me. But there are plenty of cases where I feel like the most likely response would be some kind of eye roll (or, worse, a real loss of respect), and I keep quiet.

Another way to phrase it is that it doesn't feel "safe".

To dig up the lede the rest of the way, I'm talking about the effect of a lack of psychological safety. That "belief you won't be humiliated" translates directly into "belief that it's OK to be yourself".

If you worry your coworkers might assume you're an airhead if you try to lighten the mood during an outage, you probably won't try to lighten the mood.

And that sucks! I sure don't want to work at a place where I feel like that.
