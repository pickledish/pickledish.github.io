title: "Honda HR-V Measurements"
permalink: /posts/hr-v/

My fiance Hannah and I got a car recently!

Specifically, it is a used 2021 Honda HR-V "sport". We like it because it's quite small on the outside (and relatedly gets great gas mileage), while also being roomier on the inside than other cars in its class thanks to its flexible rear seating.

And, more importantly, it's very very blue:

FOO

Anyways!

Before settling on the HR-V, we researched a bunch of different cars to determine what would work best for us. During this time, I came across [Cars101.com](http://www.cars101.com/), a glriously old-fashioned and information-packed website about Subaru cars maintained by a guy named Joe Spitz. Among other things, his site includes diagrams with hand-measured lengths for every aspect of the cars, in particular their cargo areas.

For us detail-oriented folk, it's pure gold! I used it to ____. Of course, I wasn't able to find anything equivalent for the HR-V (or any other car for that matter), which

And so, with the idea that maybe someone else might find it useful in the future, I've decided to

> **Note**: I've stolen the first two pictures from Joe's website, since they were already nice and had all the labels. They are thus pictures of a Subaru Forester and not a Honda HR-V, but the measurements are indeed from our HR-V. The last picture, of the seats flipped up, is of our car since no Subaru has an equivalent. I tried to keep the same style.

## Maximum Rectangles

| Configuration | Components | Measurements | Volume |
|:--------------|:-----------|:-------------|-------:|
| Rear seats down, tall item | ? x Q x D | 56" x 37" x 39.5" | 47.3 ft<sup>3</sup> |
| Rear seats down, long item | R x T x D | 62” x 25" x 39.5" | 35.4 ft<sup>3</sup> |
| Rear seats down, very long item | V x T x E | 73" x 25" x 24" | 25.4 ft<sup>3</sup> |
| Rear seats up, wide item | 6 x 3 x 1 | 52" x 22" x 46" | 30.5 ft<sup>3</sup> |
| Rear seats up, tall item | 5 x 4 x 2 | 21.5” x 31" x 48" | 18.5 ft<sup>3</sup> |

> For the "?", I didn't measure this, but it's the distance to the front seats from the normal of roof of the car where it meets the top of the rear windshield. I'm estimating this number to be about 6" less than R, it might be a little more.
