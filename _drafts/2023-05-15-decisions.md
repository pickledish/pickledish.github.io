I've been witnessing a, uh, higher-than-average number of bad decisions being made recently, and I'm kind of annoyed.

I want to be clear, I wouldn't be annoyed if these were bad decisions with good reasons behind them. Like, did external constraints box you into a situation with only bad choices, or maybe you tried to collect some opinions but got a very one-sided group of people by accident? Different problem, you did your best!

No, what I'm bitter about are bad decisions made from bad reasoning -- logical fallacies, the most avoidable kind of bad decision (and thus the most frustrating to witness) -- and I wanted to highlight a few specific stupid patterns.

- **It didn't work when I tried it**: This one happens when a person tries out a new technique of some kind (a new process, a new software library, whatever), does a bad job of the implementation, and then concludes "well, that technique just sucks I guess". This one's essentially an ego problem -- the implicit assumption is that it's more likely ___ than that they didn't understand it well enough to implement it correctly.

- **The evidence doesn't matter**: You know how a lot of people talk about wanting to make "data-driven" decisions? And yet how, when actually presented with that data, they just so happen to manage to interpret it in a way which supports the thing they had already wanted to do in the first place? Yeah, that's this one, also known as "____"[cheeky]. Real evidence-based decisionmaking can only occur when youâ€™re not walking in with a massive bias beforehand.

- **Foo**
